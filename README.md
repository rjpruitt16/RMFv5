# RMFv5
A side project to build a social media where people can rate each other. Its a good start. The backend is ready to connect users. I think I would have prefered using mongoDB for storage rather the JPA and JDBC. I am moving away from this project, so I can learn Dart/Flutter. The code was written to be human readable and tested.

List of changes needed for Deployment
- Dockers and Kubernetes setup
- Change Database to MongoDb.
- Implement a rating feature for Users
